=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<sudo> allows a permitted user to execute a I<command> as the
superuser or another user, as specified in the I<sudoers> file.
The real and effective uid and gid are set to match those of the
target user as specified in the passwd file and the group vector
is initialized based on the group file (unless the B<-P> option was
specified).  If the invoking user is root or if the target user is
the same as the invoking user, no password is required.  Otherwise,
B<sudo> requires that users authenticate themselves with a password
by default (NOTE: in the default configuration this is the user's
password, not the root password).  Once a user has been authenticated,
a timestamp is updated and the user may then use sudo without a
password for a short period of time (C<@timeout@> minutes unless
overridden in I<sudoers>).

When invoked as B<sudoedit>, the B<-e> option (described below),
is implied.

B<sudo> determines who is an authorized user by consulting the file
F<@sysconfdir@/sudoers>.  By giving B<sudo> the B<-v> flag a user
can update the time stamp without running a I<command.> The password
prompt itself will also time out if the user's password is not
entered within C<@password_timeout@> minutes (unless overridden via
I<sudoers>).

If a user who is not listed in the I<sudoers> file tries to run a
command via B<sudo>, mail is sent to the proper authorities, as
defined at configure time or in the I<sudoers> file (defaults to
C<@mailto@>).  Note that the mail will not be sent if an unauthorized
user tries to run sudo with the B<-l> or B<-v> flags.  This allows
users to determine for themselves whether or not they are allowed
to use B<sudo>.

If B<sudo> is run by root and the C<SUDO_USER> environment variable
is set, B<sudo> will use this value to determine who the actual
user is.  This can be used by a user to log commands through sudo
even when a root shell has been invoked.  It also allows the B<-e>
flag to remain useful even when being run via a sudo-run script or
program.  Note however, that the sudoers lookup is still done for
root, not the user specified by C<SUDO_USER>.

B<sudo> can log both successful and unsuccessful attempts (as well
as errors) to syslog(3), a log file, or both.  By default B<sudo>
will log via syslog(3) but this is changeable at configure time
or via the I<sudoers> file.

=head1 OPTIONS

B<sudo> accepts the following command line options:

=over 4

=item -a

The B<-a> (I<authentication type>) option causes B<sudo> to use the
specified authentication type when validating the user, as allowed
by /etc/login.conf.  The system administrator may specify a list
of sudo-specific authentication methods by adding an "auth-sudo"
entry in /etc/login.conf.  This option is only available on systems
that support BSD authentication where B<sudo> has been configured
with the --with-bsdauth option.

=item -b

The B<-b> (I<background>) option tells B<sudo> to run the given
command in the background.  Note that if you use the B<-b>
option you cannot use shell job control to manipulate the process.

=item -C fd

Normally, B<sudo> will close all open file descriptors other than
standard input, standard output and standard error.  The B<-C>
(I<close from>) option allows the user to specify a starting point
above the standard error (file descriptor three).  Values less than
three are not permitted.  This option is only available if the
administrator has enabled the I<closefrom_override> option in
L<sudoers(@mansectform@)>.

=item -c

The B<-c> (I<class>) option causes B<sudo> to run the specified command
with resources limited by the specified login class.  The I<class>
argument can be either a class name as defined in /etc/login.conf,
or a single '-' character.  Specifying a I<class> of C<-> indicates
that the command should be run restricted by the default login
capabilities for the user the command is run as.  If the I<class>
argument specifies an existing user class, the command must be run
as root, or the B<sudo> command must be run from a shell that is already
root.  This option is only available on systems with BSD login classes
where B<sudo> has been configured with the --with-logincap option.

=item -e

The B<-e> (I<edit>) option indicates that, instead of running
a command, the user wishes to edit one or more files.  In lieu
of a command, the string "sudoedit" is used when consulting
the I<sudoers> file.  If the user is authorized by I<sudoers>
the following steps are taken:

=over 8

=item 1.

Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited with the owner
set to the invoking user.

=item 2.

The editor specified by the C<VISUAL> or C<EDITOR> environment
variables is run to edit the temporary files.  If neither C<VISUAL>
nor C<EDITOR> are set, the program listed in the I<editor> I<sudoers>
variable is used.

=item 3.

If they have been modified, the temporary files are copied back to
their original location and the temporary versions are removed.

=back

If the specified file does not exist, it will be created.  Note
that unlike most commands run by B<sudo>, the editor is run with
the invoking user's environment unmodified.  If, for some reason,
B<sudo> is unable to update a file with its edited version, the
user will receive a warning and the edited copy will remain in a
temporary file.

=item -H

The B<-H> (I<HOME>) option sets the C<HOME> environment variable
to the homedir of the target user (root by default) as specified
in passwd(@mansectform@).  By default, B<sudo> does not modify C<HOME>
(see I<set_home> and I<always_set_home> in L<sudoers(@mansectform@)>).

=item -h

The B<-h> (I<help>) option causes B<sudo> to print a usage message and exit.

=item -i

The B<-i> (I<simulate initial login>) option runs the shell specified
in the L<passwd(@mansectform@)> entry of the user that the command is
being run as.  The command name argument given to the shell begins
with a `C<->' to tell the shell to run as a login shell.  B<sudo>
attempts to change to that user's home directory before running the
shell.  It also initializes the environment, leaving I<TERM>
unchanged, setting I<HOME>, I<SHELL>, I<USER>, I<LOGNAME>, and
I<PATH>, and unsetting all other environment variables.

=item -K

The B<-K> (sure I<kill>) option is like B<-k> except that it removes
the user's timestamp entirely.  Like B<-k>, this option does not
require a password.

=item -k

The B<-k> (I<kill>) option to B<sudo> invalidates the user's timestamp
by setting the time on it to the epoch.  The next time B<sudo> is
run a password will be required.  This option does not require a password
and was added to allow a user to revoke B<sudo> permissions from a .logout
file.

=item -L

The B<-L> (I<list> defaults) option will list out the parameters
that may be set in a I<Defaults> line along with a short description
for each.  This option is useful in conjunction with grep(1).

=item -l [I<command>]

If no I<command> is specified, the B<-l> (I<list>) option will list
the allowed (and forbidden) commands for the invoking user (or the
user specified by the B<-U> option) on the current host.  If a
I<command> is specified and is permitted by I<sudoers>, the
fully-qualified path to the command is displayed along with any
command line arguments.  If I<command> is not allowed, B<sudo> will
exit with a return value of 1.

=item -P

The B<-P> (I<preserve group vector>) option causes B<sudo> to
preserve the invoking user's group vector unaltered.  By default,
B<sudo> will initialize the group vector to the list of groups the
target user is in.  The real and effective group IDs, however, are
still set to match the target user.

=item -p

The B<-p> (I<prompt>) option allows you to override the default
password prompt and use a custom one.  The following percent (`C<%>')
escapes are supported:

=over 8

=item C<%u>

expanded to the invoking user's login name

=item C<%U>

expanded to the login name of the user the command will
be run as (defaults to root)

=item C<%h>

expanded to the local hostname without the domain name

=item C<%H>

expanded to the local hostname including the domain name
(on if the machine's hostname is fully qualified or the I<fqdn>
sudoers option is set)

=item C<%%>

two consecutive C<%> characters are collapsed into a single C<%> character

=back

=item -S

The B<-S> (I<stdin>) option causes B<sudo> to read the password from
the standard input instead of the terminal device.

=item -s

The B<-s> (I<shell>) option runs the shell specified by the I<SHELL>
environment variable if it is set or the shell as specified
in L<passwd(@mansectform@)>.

=item -U

The B<-U> (I<other user>) option is used in conjunction with the B<-l>
option to specify the user whose privileges should be listed.  Only
root or a user with B<sudo> C<ALL> on the current host may use this
option.

=item -u

The B<-u> (I<user>) option causes B<sudo> to run the specified command
as a user other than I<root>.  To specify a I<uid> instead of a
I<username>, use I<#uid>.  Note that if the I<targetpw> Defaults
option is set (see L<sudoers(@mansectform@)>) it is not possible
to run commands with a uid not listed in the password database.

=item -V

The B<-V> (I<version>) option causes B<sudo> to print the version
number and exit.  If the invoking user is already root the B<-V>
option will print out a list of the defaults B<sudo> was compiled
with as well as the machine's local network addresses.

=item -v

If given the B<-v> (I<validate>) option, B<sudo> will update the
user's timestamp, prompting for the user's password if necessary.
This extends the B<sudo> timeout for another C<@timeout@> minutes
(or whatever the timeout is set to in I<sudoers>) but does not run
a command.

=item --

The B<--> flag indicates that B<sudo> should stop processing command
line arguments.  It is most useful in conjunction with the B<-s> flag.

=back

=head1 RETURN VALUES

Upon successful execution of a program, the return value from B<sudo>
will simply be the return value of the program that was executed.

Otherwise, B<sudo> quits with an exit value of 1 if there is a
configuration/permission problem or if B<sudo> cannot execute the
given command.  In the latter case the error string is printed to
stderr.  If B<sudo> cannot L<stat(2)> one or more entries in the user's
C<PATH> an error is printed on stderr.  (If the directory does not
exist or if it is not really a directory, the entry is ignored and
no error is printed.)  This should not happen under normal
circumstances.  The most common reason for L<stat(2)> to return
"permission denied" is if you are running an automounter and one
of the directories in your C<PATH> is on a machine that is currently
unreachable.

=head1 SECURITY NOTES

B<sudo> tries to be safe when executing external commands.  Variables
that control how dynamic loading and binding is done can be used
to subvert the program that B<sudo> runs.  To combat this the
C<LD_*>, C<_RLD_*>, C<SHLIB_PATH> (HP-UX only), and C<LIBPATH> (AIX
only) environment variables are removed from the environment passed
on to all commands executed.  B<sudo> will also remove the C<IFS>,
C<CDPATH>, C<ENV>, C<BASH_ENV>, C<KRB_CONF>, C<KRBCONFDIR>, C<KRBTKFILE>,
C<KRB5_CONFIG>, C<LOCALDOMAIN>, C<RES_OPTIONS>, C<HOSTALIASES>,
C<NLSPATH>, C<PATH_LOCALE>, C<TERMINFO>, C<TERMINFO_DIRS> and
C<TERMPATH> variables as they too can pose a threat.  If the
C<TERMCAP> variable is set and is a pathname, it too is ignored.
Additionally, if the C<LC_*> or C<LANGUAGE> variables contain the
C</> or C<%> characters, they are ignored.  Environment variables
with a value beginning with C<()> are also removed as they could
be interpreted as B<bash> functions.  If B<sudo> has been
compiled with SecurID support, the C<VAR_ACE>, C<USR_ACE> and
C<DLC_ACE> variables are cleared as well.  The list of environment
variables that B<sudo> clears is contained in the output of
C<sudo -V> when run as root.

To prevent command spoofing, B<sudo> checks "." and "" (both denoting
current directory) last when searching for a command in the user's
PATH (if one or both are in the PATH).  Note, however, that the
actual C<PATH> environment variable is I<not> modified and is passed
unchanged to the program that B<sudo> executes.

For security reasons, if your OS supports shared libraries and does
not disable user-defined library search paths for setuid programs
(most do), you should either use a linker option that disables this
behavior or link B<sudo> statically.

B<sudo> will check the ownership of its timestamp directory
(F<@timedir@> by default) and ignore the directory's contents if
it is not owned by root and only writable by root.  On systems that
allow non-root users to give away files via L<chown(2)>, if the timestamp
directory is located in a directory writable by anyone (e.g.: F</tmp>),
it is possible for a user to create the timestamp directory before
B<sudo> is run.  However, because B<sudo> checks the ownership and
mode of the directory and its contents, the only damage that can
be done is to "hide" files by putting them in the timestamp dir.
This is unlikely to happen since once the timestamp dir is owned
by root and inaccessible by any other user the user placing files
there would be unable to get them back out.  To get around this
issue you can use a directory that is not world-writable for the
timestamps (F</var/adm/sudo> for instance) or create F<@timedir@>
with the appropriate owner (root) and permissions (0700) in the
system startup files.

B<sudo> will not honor timestamps set far in the future.
Timestamps with a date greater than current_time + 2 * C<TIMEOUT>
will be ignored and sudo will log and complain.  This is done to
keep a user from creating his/her own timestamp with a bogus
date on systems that allow users to give away files.

Please note that B<sudo> will normally only log the command it
explicitly runs.  If a user runs a command such as C<sudo su> or
C<sudo sh>, subsequent commands run from that shell will I<not> be
logged, nor will B<sudo>'s access control affect them.  The same
is true for commands that offer shell escapes (including most
editors).  Because of this, care must be taken when giving users
access to commands via B<sudo> to verify that the command does not
inadvertently give the user an effective root shell.  For more
information, please see the C<PREVENTING SHELL ESCAPES> section in
L<sudoers(@mansectform@)>.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

B<sudo> utilizes the following environment variables:

 EDITOR			Default editor to use in -e (sudoedit) mode if
			VISUAL is not set

 HOME			In -s or -H mode (or if sudo was configured with
			the --enable-shell-sets-home option), set to
			homedir of the target user

 PATH			Set to a sane value if sudo was configured with
			the --with-secure-path option

 SHELL			Used to determine shell to run with -s option

 SUDO_PROMPT		Used as the default password prompt

 SUDO_COMMAND		Set to the command run by sudo

 SUDO_USER		Set to the login of the user who invoked sudo

 SUDO_UID		Set to the uid of the user who invoked sudo

 SUDO_GID		Set to the gid of the user who invoked sudo

 SUDO_PS1		If set, PS1 will be set to its value

 USER			Set to the target user (root unless the -u option
			is specified)

 VISUAL			Default editor to use in -e (sudoedit) mode

=head1 FILES

 @sysconfdir@/sudoers		List of who can run what
 @timedir@		Directory containing timestamps

=head1 EXAMPLES

Note: the following examples assume suitable L<sudoers(@mansectform@)> entries.

To get a file listing of an unreadable directory:

 $ sudo ls /usr/local/protected

To list the home directory of user yazza on a machine where the
file system holding ~yazza is not exported as root:

 $ sudo -u yazza ls ~yazza

To edit the F<index.html> file as user www:

 $ sudo -u www vi ~www/htdocs/index.html

To shutdown a machine:

 $ sudo shutdown -r +15 "quick reboot"

To make a usage listing of the directories in the /home
partition.  Note that this runs the commands in a sub-shell
to make the C<cd> and file redirection work.

 $ sudo sh -c "cd /home ; du -s * | sort -rn > USAGE"

=head1 CAVEATS

There is no easy way to prevent a user from gaining a root shell
if that user is allowed to run arbitrary commands via B<sudo>.
Also, many programs (such as editors) allow the user to run commands
via shell escapes, thus avoiding B<sudo>'s checks.  However, on
most systems it is possible to prevent shell escapes with B<sudo>'s
I<noexec> functionality.  See the L<sudoers(@mansectform@)> manual
for details.

It is not meaningful to run the C<cd> command directly via sudo, e.g.

 $ sudo cd /usr/local/protected

since when whe command exits the parent process (your shell) will
still be the same.  Please see the EXAMPLES section for more information.

If users have sudo C<ALL> there is nothing to prevent them from
creating their own program that gives them a root shell regardless
of any '!' elements in the user specification.

Running shell scripts via B<sudo> can expose the same kernel bugs that
make setuid shell scripts unsafe on some operating systems (if your OS
has a /dev/fd/ directory, setuid shell scripts are generally safe).
