Known bugs in sudo version 1.6.9
================================

1) Sudo should have an option to log when removing "dangerous"
   environment variables.

2) On DUNIX in sia mode, hitting return at the prompt does not quit.

3) In list mode (sudo -l), characters escaped with a backslash
   are shown verbatim with the backslash.

For a list of things that are not bugs but that I would like to
add / fix, please see the TODO file.
