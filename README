This is the CU version of sudo, release 1.5.3

The sudo philosophy
===================

Sudo is a program designed to allow a sysadmin to give limited root privileges
to users and log root activity.  The basic philosophy is to give as few
privileges as possible but still allow people to get their work done.

Where to find sudo
==================
Before you try and build sudo, *please* make sure you have the current
version.  The latest sudo may always be gotten via anonymous ftp
from ftp.courtesan.com in the directory /pub/sudo/.
The distribution is cu-sudo.vM.m.tar.Z where `M' is the major
version number and `m' is the minor version number.
BETA versions of sudo may also be available.  If you join
the `sudo-workers' mailing list you will get the BETA announcements
(see the `Mailing lists' section below).

What's new
==========
For a history of CU sudo please see the HISTORY file that came with the
release.  Please note that while this source is based on the Root
Group's sudo 1.1, the code has been changed significantly, so please
do not bother them with bugs in CU sudo.  Bug reports for this sudo
should be sent to sudo-bugs@courtesan.com.

For a complete list of changes, see the CHANGES file.  For a summary,
see the web page, http://www.courtesan.com/courtesan/products/sudo/.

System requirements
===================

Sudo requires a machine running UN*X (most flavors of BSD, SYSV, or
POSIX will do), a C compiler, and a yacc-compatible parser generator
(yacc, byacc, bison).  If you wish to modify the tokenizer then you
will need flex version 2.5.2 or later.  (sudo comes with a pre-flex'd
tokenizer).  You can get flex via anonymous ftp from
ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/pub/flex* as well as any GNU mirror.

Building the release
===================

Please read the installation guide in the `INSTALL' file before
trying to build sudo.  Things have changed quite a bit from the
previous release (1.4).  The `RUNSON' file contains a list of
of platforms that this version of sudo is known to work on.  If you
can add to this list, please send mail to sudo-bugs@courtesan.com.
If something goes wrong you may want to refer to the `TROUBLESHOOTING'
file.
