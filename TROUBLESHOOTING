FAQ and troubleshooting tips for CU sudo
========================================

Q) Sudo compiles but when I run it I get "Sorry, sudo must be setuid root."
   and sudo quits.
A) Sudo must be setuid root to do its work.  You need to do something like
   `chmod 4111 /usr/local/bin/sudo'.  Also, the filesystem sudo resides
   on must *not* be mounted with the nosuid mount option or sudo will
   not be able to work.

Q) Sudo is setup to log via syslog(3) but I'm not getting any log
   messages.
A) Make sure you have an entry in your syslog.conf file to save
   the sudo messages.  The default log facility is local2
   (configurable in options.h) so you would want something like:
	local2.debug				/var/adm/sudo.log
   or
	local2.debug				@loghost
    depending whether you want to forward the messages to another
    host or keep them locally.

Q) When sudo asks me for my password it never accepts what I enter even
   though I know I entered my password correctly.
A) Try running configure with the --with-getpass option.  After this
   when you build sudo it will use the system's getpass() routine instead
   of sudo's own version.  If that doesn't work, and your OS uses shadow
   passwords, re-run configure and add the --with-C2 option.  Configure
   tries to guess whether or not you are using shadow passwords but
   it is not bulletproof.
   (see the INSTALL doc for a list of OS's that sudo knows how to get
   shadow password info for).

Q) Can I put the sudoers file in NIS/NIS+ or do I have to have a
   copy on each machine?
A) There is no support for making an NIS/NIS+ map/table out of
   the sudoers file at this time.  A good way to distribute the
   sudoers file is via rdist(1).  It is also possible to
   NFS-mount the sudoers file.

Q) I don't run sendmail on my machine.  Does this mean that I cannot
   use sudo?
A) No, you just need to comment out the MAILER #define in options.h.

Q) When I run visudo it uses vi as the editor and I hate vi.  How
   can I make it use another editor?
A) Your best bet is to enable the ENV_EDITOR option in options.h.
   This will make visudo use the editor specified by the user's
   EDITOR environmental variable.  Alternately, you can change the
   default editor by setting the EDITOR macro in options.h to
   the editor of your choice.

Q) Sudo appears to be removing some variables from my environment, why?
A) Sudo removes the following "dangerous" environmental variables
   to guard against shared library spoofing, shell voodoo, and
   kerberos server spoofing.
     IFS
     LD_*
     _RLD_*
     SHLIB_PATH (HP-UX only)
     LIB_PATH (AIX only)
     KRB_CONF (kerberos only)

Q) I can't get the s/key support to work, whatever I do sudo won't
   accept my key.  I had to run configure with --with-getpass,
   could that have something to do with it?
A) Yes, the s/key support requires that you use tgetpass() since
   most system getpass()'s only grab eight characters or so
   and s/key needs much mroe than that.  It should be possible
   to get tgetpass() to work, send mail to sudo-bugs@cs.colorado.edu
   if you need help.

Q) My C compiler complains about:
	"./options.h", line xx "/*" detected in comment
   Should I be worried?
A) No, this is due to the way options are commented out in options.h.
   Some ANSI compilers are just a bit too protective.
   If anyone have a better way to that is just as easy to uncomment
   and that doesn't produce a similar warning, please let me know.

Q) I modified parse.lex but the Makefile is not generating a new
   lex.yy.c.
A) You need to uncomment the rule in Makefile (or Makefile.in)
   that generates lex.yy.c from parse.lex.  This is not enable
   by default since sudo comes with a pre-flex'd parse.lex.
   May sure you are using flex version 2.5.2 or higher--the
   lex that came with your OS may not like parse.lex.

Q) I have a user whose login name is all capital letters or
   a mix or all capitals and numbers.  When they try to run
   sudo it says that they are not in the sudoers file but
   they really are.  What's wrong.
A) In sudo, a string consisting of all caps and numbers is
   considered to be an Alias.  Therefore, sudo will never treat
   it as a username (or a hostname).  There is no way to fix
   this will the current sudoers syntax.

Q) How can I keep sudo from asking for a password?
A) Use the 'NOPASSWD' reserved word right before the command list in
   sudoers.  See the sudoers man page and sample.sudoers for details.

Q) When I run configure, it dies with the following error:
   "no acceptable cc found in $PATH".
A) /usr/ucb/cc was the only C compiler that configure could find.
   You need to tell configure the path to the "real" C compiler
   via the --with-CC option.  On Solaris, the path is probably
   something like "/opt/SUNWspro/SC4.0/bin/cc".  If you have gcc
   that will also work.

Q) When I run configure, it dies with the following error:
   Fatal Error: config.cache exists from another platform!
   Please remove it and re-run configure.
A) configure caches the results of its tests in a file called
   config.cache to make re-running configure speedy.  However,
   if you are building sudo for a different platform the results
   in config.cache will be wrong so you need to remove config.cache.
   You can do this by "rm config.cache" or "make realclean".
   Note that "make realclean" will also remove any object files
   and configure temp files that are laying around as well.
