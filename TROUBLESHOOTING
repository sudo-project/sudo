FAQ and troubleshooting tips for CU sudo
========================================

Q) Sudo compiles but when I run it I get "Sorry, sudo must be setuid root."
   and sudo quits.
A) Sudo must be setuid root to do its work.  You need to do something like
   `chmod 4111 /usr/local/bin/sudo'.  Also, the filesystem sudo resides
   on must *not* be mounted with the nosuid mount option or sudo will
   not be able to work.

Q) Sudo is setup to log via syslog(3) but I'm not getting any log
   messages.
A) Make sure you have an entry in your syslog.conf file to save
   the sudo messages.  The default log facility is local2
   (configurable via configure) so you would want something like:
	local2.debug				/var/adm/sudo.log
   or
	local2.debug				@loghost
    depending whether you want to forward the messages to another
    host or keep them locally.  Don't forget to send a SIGHUP to
    your syslogd so that it re-reads its conf file.  Also, remember
    that syslogd does not create log files, you need to create the
    file before syslogd will log to it (ie: touch /var/adm/sudo.log).
    Note:  the facility ("local2.debug") must be separated from the 
	   destination ("/var/adm/sudo.log" or "@loghost") by
	   tabs, *not* spaces.  This is a common error.

Q) When sudo asks me for my password it never accepts what I enter even
   though I know I entered my password correctly.
A) Try running configure with the --with-getpass option.  After this
   when you build sudo it will use the system's getpass() routine instead
   of sudo's own version.  If your system uses shadow passwords, it
   is possible that sudo didn't detect this.  Take a look at the
   generated config.h file and verify that the C function used for
   shadow password lookups was detected.  For instance, for SVR4-style
   shadow passwords, HAVE_GETSPNAM should be defined (you can search
   for the string "shadow passwords" in config.h with your editor).
   Note that there is no define for 4.4BSD-based shadow passwords
   since that just uses the standard getpw* routines.

Q) I don't want the sudoers file in /etc, how can I specify where it
   should go?
A) Use the --sysconfdir option to configure.  Ie:
   configure --sysconfdir=/dir/you/want/sudoers/in

Q) Can I put the sudoers file in NIS/NIS+ or do I have to have a
   copy on each machine?
A) There is no support for making an NIS/NIS+ map/table out of
   the sudoers file at this time.  A good way to distribute the
   sudoers file is via rdist(1).  It is also possible to
   NFS-mount the sudoers file.

Q) I don't run sendmail on my machine.  Does this mean that I cannot
   use sudo?
A) No, you just need to run use the --without-sendmail argument to configure.

Q) When I run visudo it uses vi as the editor and I hate vi.  How
   can I make it use another editor?
A) Your best bet is to run configure with the --with-env-editor switch.
   This will make visudo use the editor specified by the user's
   EDITOR environment variable.  Alternately, you can run configure
   with the --with-editor=path_to_your_editor.

Q) Sudo appears to be removing some variables from my environment, why?
A) Sudo removes the following "dangerous" environment variables
   to guard against shared library spoofing, shell voodoo, and
   kerberos server spoofing.
     IFS
     ENV
     BASH_ENV
     LD_*
     _RLD_*
     SHLIB_PATH (HP-UX only)
     LIB_PATH (AIX only)
     KRB_CONF (kerberos only)

Q) I can't get the s/key support to work, whatever I do sudo won't
   accept my key.  I had to run configure with --with-getpass,
   could that have something to do with it?
A) Yes, the s/key support requires that you use tgetpass() since
   most system getpass()'s only grab eight characters or so
   and s/key needs much mroe than that.  It should be possible
   to get tgetpass() to work, send mail to sudo-bugs@courtesan.com
   if you need help.

Q) I modified parse.lex but the Makefile is not generating a new
   lex.yy.c.
A) You need to uncomment the rule in Makefile (or Makefile.in)
   that generates lex.yy.c from parse.lex.  This is not enable
   by default since sudo comes with a pre-flex'd parse.lex.
   May sure you are using flex version 2.5.2 or higher--the
   lex that came with your OS may not like parse.lex.

Q) How can I keep sudo from asking for a password?
A) Use the 'NOPASSWD' reserved word right before the command list in
   sudoers.  See the sudoers man page and sample.sudoers for details.

Q) When I run configure, it dies with the following error:
   "no acceptable cc found in $PATH".
A) /usr/ucb/cc was the only C compiler that configure could find.
   You need to tell configure the path to the "real" C compiler
   via the --with-CC option.  On Solaris, the path is probably
   something like "/opt/SUNWspro/SC4.0/bin/cc".  If you have gcc
   that will also work.

Q) When I run configure, it dies with the following error:
   Fatal Error: config.cache exists from another platform!
   Please remove it and re-run configure.
A) configure caches the results of its tests in a file called
   config.cache to make re-running configure speedy.  However,
   if you are building sudo for a different platform the results
   in config.cache will be wrong so you need to remove config.cache.
   You can do this by "rm config.cache" or "make realclean".
   Note that "make realclean" will also remove any object files
   and configure temp files that are laying around as well.

Q) I built sudo on a Solaris 2.5 machine but the resulting binary
   doesn't work on Solaris 2.4.  Why?
A) Sun added many of the BSD library functions from -lucb into
   libc for Solaris 2.5.  To generate a sudo binary on Solaris 2.5
   that will run on Solaris 2.4 just add "getwd.o" to LIBOBJS
   in the Makefile and recompile.

Q) When I compile sudo on Solaris with gcc I get:
    logging.c: In function `send_mail':
    logging.c:448: storage size of `action' isn't known
    *** Error code 1
A) You probably didn't install the gcc-fixed include files.
   Try adding -D__EXTENSIONS__ to CFLAGS in the Makefile.

Q) When I run "visudo" it says "sudoers file busy, try again later."
   and doesn't do anything.
A) You have a stale sudoers temporary file.  The default location is
   /etc/stmp.  If you delete this file visudo will be happy again,
   but make sure to check that no one else is running visudo at
   the time.

Q) When I try to use "cd" with sudo it says "cd: command not found".
A) "cd" is a shell builtin, you can't run it as a command since
   a child process (sudo) cannot affect the current working directory
   of the parent (your shell).

Q) When I try to use "cd" with sudo the command completes without
   errors but nothing happens.
A) Some SVR4-derived OS's include a /usr/bin/cd command for reasons
   unfathomable.  A "cd" command is totally useless since a child process
   cannot affect the current working directory of the parent (your shell).

Q) How do you pronounce `sudo'?
A) soo-doo (for superuser do).
