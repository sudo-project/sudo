       sudoers - list of which users may execute what

       The _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file is composed two types of entries: aliases
       (basically variables) and user specifications (which
       specify who may run what).  The grammar of _s_u_d_o_e_r_s will be
       described below in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF).
       Don't despair if you don't know what EBNF is, it is fairly
       simple and the definitions below are annotated.

       QQQQuuuuiiiicccckkkk gggguuuuiiiiddddeeee ttttoooo EEEEBBBBNNNNFFFF

       EBNF is a concise and exact way of describing the grammar
       of a language.  Each EBNF definition is made up of
       _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n _r_u_l_e_s.  Eg.

        symbol ::= definition | alternate1 | alternate2 ...

       Each _p_r_o_d_u_c_t_i_o_n _r_u_l_e references others and thus makes up a
       grammar for the language.  EBNF also contains the
       following operators, which many readers will recognize
       from regular expressions.  Do not, however, confuse them
       with "wildcard" characters, which have different meanings.

       ?       Means that the preceding symbol (or group of
               symbols) is optional.  That is, it may appear once
               or not at all.

       *       Means that the preceding symbol (or group of
               symbols) may appear zero or more times.

       +       Means that the preceding symbol (or group of
               symbols) may appear one or more times.

       Parentheses may be used to group symbols together.  For
       clarity, we will use single quotes ('') to designate what
       is a verbatim character string (as opposed to a symbol
       name).

       There are four kinds of aliases: the User_Alias,
       Runas_Alias, Host_Alias and Cmnd_Alias.

        Alias ::= 'User_Alias' = User_Alias (':' User_Alias)* |
                  'Runas_Alias' (':' Runas_Alias)* |
                  'Host_Alias' (':' Host_Alias)* |
                  'Cmnd_Alias' (':' Cmnd_Alias)*

        User_Alias ::= NAME '=' User_List

        Runas_Alias ::= NAME '=' Runas_User_List

        Host_Alias ::= NAME '=' Host_List

        Cmnd_Alias ::= NAME '=' Cmnd_List

        NAME ::= [A-Z]([A-Z][0-9]_)*

       Each _a_l_i_a_s definition is of the form

        Alias_Type NAME = item1, item2, ...

       where _A_l_i_a_s___T_y_p_e is one of User_Alias, Runas_Alias,
       Host_Alias, or Cmnd_Alias.  A NAME is a string of upper
       case letters, numbers, and the underscore characters
       ('_').  A NAME mmmmuuuusssstttt start with an upper case letter.  It
       is possible to put several alias definitions of the same
       type on a single line, joined by a semicolon (':').  Eg.

        Alias_Type NAME = item1, item2, item3 : NAME = item4, item5

       The definitions of what constitutes a valid _a_l_i_a_s member
       follow.

        User_List ::= User |
                      User ',' User_List

        User ::= '!'* username |
                 '!'* '#'uid |
                 '!'* '%'group |
                 '!'* '+'netgroup |
                 '!'* User_Alias

       A User_List is made up of one or more usernames, uids
       (prefixed with '#'), System groups (prefixed with '%'),
       netgroups (prefixed with '+') and other aliases.  Each
       list item may be prefixed with one or more '!' operators.
       An odd number of '!' operators negates the value of the
       item; an even number just cancel each other out.

        Runas_List ::= Runas_User |
                       Runas_User ',' Runas_List

        Runas_User ::= '!'* username |
                       '!'* '#'uid |
                       '!'* '%'group |
                       '!'* +netgroup |
                       '!'* Runas_Alias

       Likewise, a Runas_List has the same possible elements as a
       User_List, except that it can include a Runas_Alias,
       instead of a User_Alias.

        Host_List ::= Host |
                      Host ',' Host_List




2/Dec/1999                     1.6                              2

        Host ::= '!'* hostname |
                 '!'* ip_addr |
                 '!'* network(/netmask)? |
                 '!'* '+'netgroup |
                 '!'* Host_Alias

       A Host_List is made up of one or more hostnames, IP
       addresses, network numbers, netgroups (prefixed with '+')
       and other aliases.  Again, the value of an item may be
       negated with the '!' operator.  If you do not specify a
       netmask with a network number, the netmask of the host's
       ethernet _i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e(s) will be used when matching.  The
       netmask may be specified either in dotted quad notation
       (eg.  255.255.255.0) or CIDR notation (number of bits, eg.
       24).

        Cmnd_List ::= Cmnd |
                      Cmnd ',' Cmnd_List

        commandname ::= filename |
                        filename args |
                        filename '""'

        Cmnd ::= '!'* commandname |
                 '!'* directory |
                 '!'* Cmnd_Alias

       A Cmnd_List is a list of one or more commandnames,
       directories, and other aliases.  A commandname is a fully-
       qualified filename which may include shell-style wildcards
       (see `Wildcards' section below).  A simple filename allows
       the user to run the command with any arguments he/she
       wishes.  However, you may also command line arguments
       (including wildcards).  Alternately, you can specify "" to
       indicate that the command may only be run wwwwiiiitttthhhhoooouuuutttt command
       line arguments.  A directory is a fully qualified pathname
       ending in a '/'.  When you specify a directory in a
       Cmnd_List, the user will be able to run any file within
       that directory (but not in any subdirectories therein).

       If a Cmnd has associated command line arguments, then the
       arguments in the Cmnd must match exactly those given by
       the user on the command line (or match the wildcards if
       there are any).  Note that the following characters must
       be escaped with a '\' if they are used in command
       arguments: ',', ':', '=', '\'.

       Certain configuration options may be changed from their
       default values at runtime via one or more Default_Entry

       multiple entries match, they are applied in order.  Where

       Flags are implicitly boolean and can be turned off via the
       '!' operator.  Some integer and string parameters may also
       be used in a boolean context to disable them.  Values may
       be enclosed in double quotes (") when they contain
       multiple words.  Special characters may be escaped with a

       of rrrrooooooootttt will be used.  A Runas_Spec sets the default for

       By default, ssssuuuuddddoooo requires that a user authenticate him or
       herself before running a command.  This behavior can be
       modified via the NOPASSWD tag.  Like a Runas_Spec, the
       NOPASSWD tag sets a default for the commands that follow
       it in the Cmnd_Spec_List.  Conversely, the PASSWD tag can
       be used to reverse things.  For example:

        ray    rushmore = NOPASSWD: /bin/kill, /bin/ls, /usr/bin/lprm

       would allow the user rrrraaaayyyy to run _/_b_i_n_/_k_i_l_l, _/_b_i_n_/_l_s, and

       without authenticating himself.  If we only want rrrraaaayyyy to be
       able to run _/_b_i_n_/_k_i_l_l without a password the entry would
       be:

        ray    rushmore = NOPASSWD: /bin/kill, PASSWD: /bin/ls, /usr/bin/lprm

       as well as command line arguments in the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file.
       Wildcard matching is done via the PPPPOOOOSSSSIIIIXXXX fnmatch(3)
       routine.  Note that these are _n_o_t regular expressions.

       *       Matches any set of zero or more characters.

       ?       Matches any single character.

       [...]   Matches any character in the specified range.

       [!...]  Matches any character nnnnooootttt in the specified range.

       \x      For any character "x", evaluates to "x".  This is
               used to escape special characters such as: "*",
               "?", "[", and "}".

       The pound sign ('#') is used to indicate a comment (unless
       it occurs in the context of a user name and is followed by
       one or more digits, in which case it is treated as a uid).
       Both the comment character and any text after it, up to
       the end of the line, are ignored.

       The reserved word AAAALLLLLLLL is a a built in _a_l_i_a_s that always
       causes a match to succeed.  It can be used wherever one
       might otherwise use a Cmnd_Alias, User_Alias, Runas_Alias,
       or Host_Alias.  You should not try to define your own
       _a_l_i_a_s called AAAALLLLLLLL as the built in alias will be used in
       preference to your own.  Please note that using AAAALLLLLLLL can be
       dangerous since in a command context, it allows the user
       to run aaaannnnyyyy command on the system.

       An exclamation point ('!') can be used as a logical _n_o_t
       operator both in an _a_l_i_a_s and in front of a Cmnd.  This
       allows one to exclude certain values.  Note, however, that
       using a ! in conjunction with the built in ALL alias to
       allow a user to run "all but a few" commands rarely works
       as intended (see SECURITY NOTES below).

       Long lines can be continued with a backslash ('\') as the
       last character on the line.

       Whitespace between elements in a list as well as specicial
       syntactic characters in a _U_s_e_r _S_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n ('=', ':',
       '(', ')') is optional.

       The following characters must be escaped with a backslash
       ('\') when used as part of a word (eg. a username or
       hostname): '@', '!', '=', ':', ',', '(', ')', '\'.

       Below are example _s_u_d_o_e_r_s entries.  Admittedly, some of

        Cmnd_Alias     SU = /usr/bin/su

       Here we override some of the compiled in default values.
       We want sudo to log via _s_y_s_l_o_g(3) using the _a_u_t_h facility
       in all cases.  We don't want to subject the full time
       staff to the ssssuuuuddddoooo lecture, and user mmmmiiiilllllllleeeerrrrtttt need not give
       a password.  In addition, on the machines in the _S_E_R_V_E_R_S
       Host_Alias, we keep an additional local log file and make
       sure we log the year in each log line since the log
       entries will be kept around for several years.

       The _U_s_e_r _s_p_e_c_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n is the part that actually

       It is generally not effective to "subtract" commands from

       circumvent this by copying the desired command to a
