       ssuuddoo allows a permitted user to execute a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d as the superuser or
       another user, as specified in the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file.  The real and effective
       uid and gid are set to match those of the target user as specified in
       the passwd file and the group vector is initialized based on the group
       file (unless the --PP option was specified).  If the invoking user is
       root or if the target user is the same as the invoking user, no
       password is required.  Otherwise, ssuuddoo requires that users authenticate
       themselves with a password by default (NOTE: in the default
       configuration this is the user's password, not the root password).
       Once a user has been authenticated, a timestamp is updated and the user
       may then use sudo without a password for a short period of time (5
       minutes unless overridden in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s).

       When invoked as ssuuddooeeddiitt, the --ee option (described below), is implied.

       ssuuddoo determines who is an authorized user by consulting the file
       _/_e_t_c_/_s_u_d_o_e_r_s.  By running ssuuddoo with the --vv option, a user can update
       the time stamp without running a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d. The password prompt itself
       will also time out if the user's password is not entered within 5
       minutes (unless overridden via _s_u_d_o_e_r_s).

       If a user who is not listed in the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file tries to run a command
       via ssuuddoo, mail is sent to the proper authorities, as defined at
       configure time or in the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file (defaults to root).  Note that
       the mail will not be sent if an unauthorized user tries to run sudo
       with the --ll or --vv option.  This allows users to determine for
       themselves whether or not they are allowed to use ssuuddoo.

       If ssuuddoo is run by root and the SUDO_USER environment variable is set,
       ssuuddoo will use this value to determine who the actual user is.  This can
       be used by a user to log commands through sudo even when a root shell
       has been invoked.  It also allows the --ee option to remain useful even
       when being run via a sudo-run script or program.  Note however, that
       the sudoers lookup is still done for root, not the user specified by
       SUDO_USER.

       ssuuddoo can log both successful and unsuccessful attempts (as well as
       errors) to _s_y_s_l_o_g(3), a log file, or both.  By default ssuuddoo will log

       via _s_y_s_l_o_g(3) but this is changeable at configure time or via the
       _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       ssuuddoo accepts the following command line options:

       -A          Normally, if ssuuddoo requires a password, it will read it from
                   the current terminal.  If the --AA (_a_s_k_p_a_s_s) option is
                   specified, a helper program is executed to read the user's
                   password and output the password to the standard output.
                   If the SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable is set, it
                   specifies the path to the helper program.  Otherwise, the
                   value specified by the _a_s_k_p_a_s_s option in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s(4) is
                   used.

       -a _t_y_p_e     The --aa (_a_u_t_h_e_n_t_i_c_a_t_i_o_n _t_y_p_e) option causes ssuuddoo to use the
                   specified authentication type when validating the user, as
                   allowed by _/_e_t_c_/_l_o_g_i_n_._c_o_n_f.  The system administrator may
                   specify a list of sudo-specific authentication methods by
                   adding an "auth-sudo" entry in _/_e_t_c_/_l_o_g_i_n_._c_o_n_f.  This
                   option is only available on systems that support BSD
                   authentication.

       -b          The --bb (_b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d) option tells ssuuddoo to run the given
                   command in the background.  Note that if you use the --bb
                   option you cannot use shell job control to manipulate the
                   process.

       -C _f_d       Normally, ssuuddoo will close all open file descriptors other
                   than standard input, standard output and standard error.
                   The --CC (_c_l_o_s_e _f_r_o_m) option allows the user to specify a
                   starting point above the standard error (file descriptor
                   three).  Values less than three are not permitted.  This
                   option is only available if the administrator has enabled
                   the _c_l_o_s_e_f_r_o_m___o_v_e_r_r_i_d_e option in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s(4).

       -c _c_l_a_s_s    The --cc (_c_l_a_s_s) option causes ssuuddoo to run the specified
                   command with resources limited by the specified login
                   class.  The _c_l_a_s_s argument can be either a class name as
                   defined in _/_e_t_c_/_l_o_g_i_n_._c_o_n_f, or a single '-' character.
                   Specifying a _c_l_a_s_s of - indicates that the command should
                   be run restricted by the default login capabilities for the
                   user the command is run as.  If the _c_l_a_s_s argument
                   specifies an existing user class, the command must be run
                   as root, or the ssuuddoo command must be run from a shell that
                   is already root.  This option is only available on systems
                   with BSD login classes.

       -E          The --EE (_p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t) option will override the
                   _e_n_v___r_e_s_e_t option in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s(4)).  It is only available when
                   either the matching command has the SETENV tag or the
                   _s_e_t_e_n_v option is set in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s(4).

       -e          The --ee (_e_d_i_t) option indicates that, instead of running a

                   command, the user wishes to edit one or more files.  In
                   lieu of a command, the string "sudoedit" is used when
                   consulting the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s file.  If the user is authorized by
                   _s_u_d_o_e_r_s the following steps are taken:

                   1.  Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited
                       with the owner set to the invoking user.

                   2.  The editor specified by the SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or
                       EDITOR environment variables is run to edit the
                       temporary files.  If none of SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or
                       EDITOR are set, the first program listed in the _e_d_i_t_o_r
                       _s_u_d_o_e_r_s variable is used.

                   3.  If they have been modified, the temporary files are
                       copied back to their original location and the
                       temporary versions are removed.

                   If the specified file does not exist, it will be created.
                   Note that unlike most commands run by ssuuddoo, the editor is
                   run with the invoking user's environment unmodified.  If,
                   for some reason, ssuuddoo is unable to update a file with its
                   edited version, the user will receive a warning and the
                   edited copy will remain in a temporary file.

       -g _g_r_o_u_p    Normally, ssuuddoo sets the primary group to the one specified
                   by the passwd database for the user the command is being
                   run as (by default, root).  The --gg (_g_r_o_u_p) option causes
                   ssuuddoo to run the specified command with the primary group
                   set to _g_r_o_u_p.  To specify a _g_i_d instead of a _g_r_o_u_p _n_a_m_e,
                   use _#_g_i_d.  When running commands as a _g_i_d, many shells
                   require that the '#' be escaped with a backslash ('\').  If
                   no --uu option is specified, the command will be run as the
                   invoking user (not root).  In either case, the primary
                   group will be set to _g_r_o_u_p.

       -H          The --HH (_H_O_M_E) option sets the HOME environment variable to
                   the homedir of the target user (root by default) as
                   specified in _p_a_s_s_w_d(4).  By default, ssuuddoo does not modify
                   HOME (see _s_e_t___h_o_m_e and _a_l_w_a_y_s___s_e_t___h_o_m_e in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s(4)).

       -h          The --hh (_h_e_l_p) option causes ssuuddoo to print a usage message
                   and exit.

       -i [command]
                   The --ii (_s_i_m_u_l_a_t_e _i_n_i_t_i_a_l _l_o_g_i_n) option runs the shell
                   specified in the _p_a_s_s_w_d(4) entry of the target user as a
                   login shell.  This means that login-specific resource files
                   such as .profile or .login will be read by the shell.  If a
                   command is specified, it is passed to the shell for
                   execution.  Otherwise, an interactive shell is executed.
                   ssuuddoo attempts to change to that user's home directory
                   before running the shell.  It also initializes the
                   environment, leaving _D_I_S_P_L_A_Y and _T_E_R_M unchanged, setting

                   _H_O_M_E, _S_H_E_L_L, _U_S_E_R, _L_O_G_N_A_M_E, and _P_A_T_H, as well as the
                   contents of _/_e_t_c_/_e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t on Linux and AIX systems.  All
                   other environment variables are removed.

       -K          The --KK (sure _k_i_l_l) option is like --kk except that it removes
                   the user's timestamp entirely.  Like --kk, this option does
                   not require a password.

       -k          The --kk (_k_i_l_l) option to ssuuddoo invalidates the user's
                   timestamp by setting the time on it to the Epoch.  The next
                   time ssuuddoo is run a password will be required.  This option
                   does not require a password and was added to allow a user
                   to revoke ssuuddoo permissions from a .logout file.

       -L          The --LL (_l_i_s_t defaults) option will list out the parameters
                   that may be set in a _D_e_f_a_u_l_t_s line along with a short
                   description for each.  This option is useful in conjunction
                   with _g_r_e_p(1).

       -l[l] [_c_o_m_m_a_n_d]
                   If no _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is specified, the --ll (_l_i_s_t) option will list
                   the allowed (and forbidden) commands for the invoking user
                   (or the user specified by the --UU option) on the current
                   host.  If a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is specified and is permitted by
                   _s_u_d_o_e_r_s, the fully-qualified path to the command is
                   displayed along with any command line arguments.  If
                   _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is specified but not allowed, ssuuddoo will exit with a
                   status value of 1.  If the --ll option is specified with an ll
                   argument (i.e. --llll), or if --ll is specified multiple times,
                   a longer list format is used.

       -n          The --nn (_n_o_n_-_i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e) option prevents ssuuddoo from
                   prompting the user for a password.  If a password is
                   required for the command to run, ssuuddoo will display an error
                   messages and exit.

       -P          The --PP (_p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e _g_r_o_u_p _v_e_c_t_o_r) option causes ssuuddoo to
                   preserve the invoking user's group vector unaltered.  By
                   default, ssuuddoo will initialize the group vector to the list
                   of groups the target user is in.  The real and effective
                   group IDs, however, are still set to match the target user.

       -p _p_r_o_m_p_t   The --pp (_p_r_o_m_p_t) option allows you to override the default
                   password prompt and use a custom one.  The following
                   percent (`%') escapes are supported:

                   %H  expanded to the local hostname including the domain
                       name (on if the machine's hostname is fully qualified
                       or the _f_q_d_n _s_u_d_o_e_r_s option is set)

                   %%  two consecutive % characters are collapsed into a
                       single % character

                   The prompt specified by the --pp option will override the
                   system password prompt on systems that support PAM unless
                   the _p_a_s_s_p_r_o_m_p_t___o_v_e_r_r_i_d_e flag is disabled in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s.

       -S          The --SS (_s_t_d_i_n) option causes ssuuddoo to read the password from
                   the standard input instead of the terminal device.

       -s [command]
                   The --ss (_s_h_e_l_l) option runs the shell specified by the _S_H_E_L_L
                   environment variable if it is set or the shell as specified
                   in _p_a_s_s_w_d(4).  If a command is specified, it is passed to
                   the shell for execution.  Otherwise, an interactive shell
                   is executed.

       -U _u_s_e_r     The --UU (_o_t_h_e_r _u_s_e_r) option is used in conjunction with the
                   --ll option to specify the user whose privileges should be
                   listed.  Only root or a user with ssuuddoo ALL on the current
                   host may use this option.

       -u _u_s_e_r     The --uu (_u_s_e_r) option causes ssuuddoo to run the specified
                   command as a user other than _r_o_o_t.  To specify a _u_i_d
                   instead of a _u_s_e_r _n_a_m_e, use _#_u_i_d.  When running commands as
                   a _u_i_d, many shells require that the '#' be escaped with a
                   backslash ('\').  Note that if the _t_a_r_g_e_t_p_w Defaults option
                   is set (see _s_u_d_o_e_r_s(4)) it is not possible to run commands
                   with a uid not listed in the password database.

       -V          The --VV (_v_e_r_s_i_o_n) option causes ssuuddoo to print the version
                   number and exit.  If the invoking user is already root the
                   --VV option will print out a list of the defaults ssuuddoo was
                   compiled with as well as the machine's local network
                   addresses.

       -v          If given the --vv (_v_a_l_i_d_a_t_e) option, ssuuddoo will update the
                   user's timestamp, prompting for the user's password if
                   necessary.  This extends the ssuuddoo timeout for another 5
                   minutes (or whatever the timeout is set to in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s) but
                   does not run a command.

       --          The ---- option indicates that ssuuddoo should stop processing
                   command line arguments.  It is most useful in conjunction
                   with the --ss option.

       Environment variables to be set for the command may also be passed on

       _s_u_d_o_e_r_s, the command to be run has the SETENV tag set or the command

       forbidden.  See _s_u_d_o_e_r_s(4) for more information.

RREETTUURRNN VVAALLUUEESS
       Upon successful execution of a program, the exit status from ssuuddoo will
       simply be the exit status of the program that was executed.

       Otherwise, ssuuddoo quits with an exit value of 1 if there is a
       configuration/permission problem or if ssuuddoo cannot execute the given
       command.  In the latter case the error string is printed to stderr.  If
       ssuuddoo cannot _s_t_a_t(2) one or more entries in the user's PATH an error is
       printed on stderr.  (If the directory does not exist or if it is not
       really a directory, the entry is ignored and no error is printed.)
       This should not happen under normal circumstances.  The most common
       reason for _s_t_a_t(2) to return "permission denied" is if you are running
       an automounter and one of the directories in your PATH is on a machine
       that is currently unreachable.

SSEECCUURRIITTYY NNOOTTEESS
       ssuuddoo tries to be safe when executing external commands.

       There are two distinct ways to deal with environment variables.  By
       default, the _e_n_v___r_e_s_e_t _s_u_d_o_e_r_s option is enabled.  This causes commands
       to be executed with a minimal environment containing TERM, PATH, HOME,
       SHELL, LOGNAME, USER and USERNAME in addition to variables from the
       invoking process permitted by the _e_n_v___c_h_e_c_k and _e_n_v___k_e_e_p _s_u_d_o_e_r_s
       options.  There is effectively a whitelist for environment variables.

       If, however, the _e_n_v___r_e_s_e_t option is disabled in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s, any variables
       not explicitly denied by the _e_n_v___c_h_e_c_k and _e_n_v___d_e_l_e_t_e options are
       inherited from the invoking process.  In this case, _e_n_v___c_h_e_c_k and
       _e_n_v___d_e_l_e_t_e behave like a blacklist.  Since it is not possible to
       blacklist all potentially dangerous environment variables, use of the
       default _e_n_v___r_e_s_e_t behavior is encouraged.

       In all cases, environment variables with a value beginning with () are
       removed as they could be interpreted as bbaasshh functions.  The list of
       environment variables that ssuuddoo allows or denies is contained in the
       output of sudo -V when run as root.

       Note that the dynamic linker on most operating systems will remove
       variables that can control dynamic linking from the environment of
       setuid executables, including ssuuddoo.  Depending on the operating system
       this may include _RLD*, DYLD_*, LD_*, LDR_*, LIBPATH, SHLIB_PATH, and
       others.  These type of variables are removed from the environment
       before ssuuddoo even begins execution and, as such, it is not possible for
       ssuuddoo to preserve them.

       To prevent command spoofing, ssuuddoo checks "." and "" (both denoting

       current directory) last when searching for a command in the user's PATH
       (if one or both are in the PATH).  Note, however, that the actual PATH
       environment variable is _n_o_t modified and is passed unchanged to the
       program that ssuuddoo executes.

       ssuuddoo will check the ownership of its timestamp directory (_/_v_a_r_/_r_u_n_/_s_u_d_o
       by default) and ignore the directory's contents if it is not owned by
       root or if it is writable by a user other than root.  On systems that
       allow non-root users to give away files via _c_h_o_w_n(2), if the timestamp
       directory is located in a directory writable by anyone (e.g., _/_t_m_p), it
       is possible for a user to create the timestamp directory before ssuuddoo is
       run.  However, because ssuuddoo checks the ownership and mode of the
       directory and its contents, the only damage that can be done is to
       "hide" files by putting them in the timestamp dir.  This is unlikely to
       happen since once the timestamp dir is owned by root and inaccessible
       by any other user, the user placing files there would be unable to get
       them back out.  To get around this issue you can use a directory that
       is not world-writable for the timestamps (_/_v_a_r_/_a_d_m_/_s_u_d_o for instance)
       or create _/_v_a_r_/_r_u_n_/_s_u_d_o with the appropriate owner (root) and
       permissions (0700) in the system startup files.

       ssuuddoo will not honor timestamps set far in the future.  Timestamps with
       a date greater than current_time + 2 * TIMEOUT will be ignored and sudo
       will log and complain.  This is done to keep a user from creating
       his/her own timestamp with a bogus date on systems that allow users to
       give away files.

       Please note that ssuuddoo will normally only log the command it explicitly
       runs.  If a user runs a command such as sudo su or sudo sh, subsequent
       commands run from that shell will _n_o_t be logged, nor will ssuuddoo's access
       control affect them.  The same is true for commands that offer shell
       escapes (including most editors).  Because of this, care must be taken
       when giving users access to commands via ssuuddoo to verify that the
       command does not inadvertently give the user an effective root shell.
       For more information, please see the PREVENTING SHELL ESCAPES section
       in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s(4).

       Many people have worked on ssuuddoo over the years; this version consists
       of code written primarily by:

               Todd C. Miller

       See the HISTORY file in the ssuuddoo distribution or visit
       http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/history.html for a short history of ssuuddoo.

CCAAVVEEAATTSS
       There is no easy way to prevent a user from gaining a root shell if
       that user is allowed to run arbitrary commands via ssuuddoo.  Also, many
       programs (such as editors) allow the user to run commands via shell
       escapes, thus avoiding ssuuddoo's checks.  However, on most systems it is
       possible to prevent shell escapes with ssuuddoo's _n_o_e_x_e_c functionality.
       See the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s(4) manual for details.

       It is not meaningful to run the cd command directly via sudo, e.g.,

        $ sudo cd /usr/local/protected

       since when the command exits the parent process (your shell) will still
       be the same.  Please see the EXAMPLES section for more information.

       If users have sudo ALL there is nothing to prevent them from creating
       their own program that gives them a root shell regardless of any '!'
       elements in the user specification.

       Running shell scripts via ssuuddoo can expose the same kernel bugs that
       make setuid shell scripts unsafe on some operating systems (if your OS
       has a /dev/fd/ directory, setuid shell scripts are generally safe).
