.Nm sudo_sendlog
.Op Fl nV
.Op Fl b Ar ca_bundle
.Op Fl c Ar cert_file
.Op Fl h Ar host
.Op Fl i Ar iolog-id
.Op Fl k Ar key_file
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Op Fl r Ar restart-point
.Op Fl t Ar number
.Ar path
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
can be used to send the existing
.Nm sudoers
I/O log
.Ar path
to a remote log server such as
.Xr sudo_logsrvd @mansectsu@
for central storage.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl b , -ca-bundle
The path to a certificate authority bundle file, in PEM format,
to use instead of the system's default certificate authority database
when authenticating the log server.
The default is to use the system's default certificate authority database.
.It Fl c , -cert
The path to the client's certificate file in PEM format.
This setting is required when the connection to the remote log server
is secured with TLS.
.It Fl -help
Display a short help message to the standard output and exit.
.It Fl h , -host
Connect to the specified
.Ar host
instead of localhost.
.It Fl i , -iolog-id
Use the specified
.Ar iolog-id
when restarting a log transfer.
The
.Ar iolog-id
is reported by the server when it creates the remote I/O log.
This option may only be used in conjunction with the
.Fl r
option.
.It Fl k , -key
The path to the client's private key file in PEM format.
This setting is required when the connection to the remote log server
is secured with TLS.
.It Fl n , -no-verify
If specified, the server's certificate will not be verified during
the TLS handshake.
By default,
.Nm
verifies that the server's certificate is valid and that it contains either
the server's host name or its IP address.
This setting is only supported when the connection to the remote log server
is secured with TLS.
.It Fl p , -port
Use the specified network
.Ar port
when connecting to the log server instead of the
default, port 30344.
.It Fl r , -restart
Restart an interrupted connection to the log server.
The specified
.Ar restart-point
is used to tell the server the point in time at which to continue the log.
The
.Ar restart-point
is specified in the form
.Dq seconds,nanoseconds
and is usually the last commit point received from the server.
The
.Fl i
option must also be specified when restarting a transfer.
.It Fl t , -test
Open
.Ar number
simultaneous connections to the log server and send the specified
I/O log file on each one.
This option is useful for performance testing.
.It Fl V , -version
Print the
.Nm
version and exit.
