.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
\fBsudo_logsrvd.conf\fR
file is used to configure the
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
log server.
It uses an INI-style format made up of sections in square brackets and
\(lqkey = value\(rq
pairs specific to each section below the section name.
Depending on the key, values may be integers, booleans or strings.
Section and key names are not case sensitive, but values are.
.PP
The pound sign
(\(oq#\(cq)
is used to indicate a comment.
Both the comment character and any text after it, up to the end of
the line, are ignored.
Lines beginning with a semi-colon
(\(oq\&;\(cq)
are also ignored.
.PP
Long lines can be continued with a backslash
(\(oq\e\(cq)
as the last character on the line.
Note that leading white space is removed from the beginning of lines
even when the continuation character is used.
.PP
The
\fIEXAMPLES\fR

Each section is described in detail below.
.SS "server"
The
\fIserver\fR
section configures the address and port the server will listen on.
The following keys are recognized:
.TP 10n
listen_address = host[:port][(tls)]
The host name or IP address, optional port to listen on and
an optional Transport Layer Security (TLS) flag in parentheses.
.sp
The host may be a host name, an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address
in square brackets or the wild card entry
\(oq*\(cq.
A host setting of
\(oq*\(cq
will cause
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
to listen on all configured network interfaces.
.sp
If the optional tls flag is present,
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
will secure the connection with TLS version 1.2 or 1.3.
Versions of TLS prior to 1.2 are not supported.
See
sudo_logsrvd(8)
for details on generating TLS keys and certificates.
.sp
If a port is specified, it may either be a port number or a known
service name as defined by the system service name database.
If no port is specified, port 30343 will be used for plaintext
connections and port 30344 will be used for TLS connections.
.sp
The default value is:
.nf
.RS 16n
listen_address = *:30343
listen_address = *:30344(tls)
.RE
.fi
.RS 10n
which will listen on all configured network interfaces for both
plaintext and TLS connections.
Multiple
\fIlisten_address\fR
lines may be specified to listen on more than one port or interface.
.RE
.TP 10n
pid_file = path
The path to the file containing the process ID of the running
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR.
If set to an empty value, or if
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
is run with the
\fB\-n\fR
option, no
\fIpid_file\fR
will be created.
If
\fIpid_file\fR
refers to a symbolic link, it will be ignored.
The default value is
\fI@rundir@/sudo_logsrvd.pid\fR.
.TP 10n
tcp_keepalive = boolean
If true,
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
will enable the TCP keepalive socket option on the client connection.
This enables the periodic transmission of keepalive messages to the client.
If the client does not respond to a message, the connection will be closed.
.TP 10n
timeout = number
The amount of time, in seconds,
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
will wait for the client to respond.
A value of 0 will disable the timeout.
The default value is 30.
.TP 10n
tls_cacert = path
The path to a certificate authority bundle file, in PEM format,
to use instead of the system's default certificate authority database
when authenticating clients.
The default is to use
\fI/etc/ssl/sudo/cacert.pem\fR
if it exists, otherwise the system's default certificate authority
database is used.
.TP 10n
tls_cert = path
The path to the server's certificate file, in PEM format.
The default value is
\fI/etc/ssl/sudo/certs/logsrvd_cert.pem\fR.
.TP 10n
tls_checkpeer = bool
If true, client certificates will be validated by the server;
clients without a valid certificate will be unable to connect.
If false, no validation of client certificates will be performed.
It true and client certificates are created using a private certificate
authority, the
\fItls_cacert\fR
setting must be set to a CA bundle that contains the CA certificate
used to generate the client certificate.
The default value is
\fRfalse\fR.
.TP 10n
tls_ciphers_v12 = string
A list of ciphers to use for connections secured by TLS version 1.2 only,
separated by a colon
\(oq:\&\(cq.
See the
\fICIPHER LIST FORMAT\fR
section in
openssl-ciphers(1)
for full details.
The default value is
\fRHIGH:!aNULL\fR
which consists of encryption cipher suites with key lengths larger than
128 bits, and some cipher suites with 128-bit keys.
Cipher suites that offer no authentication are excluded.
.TP 10n
tls_ciphers_v13 = string
A list of ciphers to use for connections secured by TLS version 1.3 only,
separated by a colon
\(oq:\&\(cq.
Supported cipher suites depend on the version of OpenSSL used,
but should include the following:
.sp
.RS 16n
.PD 0
.TP 10n
TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
.TP 10n
TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
.TP 10n
TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
.TP 10n
TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256
.TP 10n
TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256
.RE
.RS 10n
.sp
The default cipher suite is TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384.
.RE
.PD
.TP 10n
tls_dhparams = path
The path to a file containing custom Diffie-Hellman parameters in PEM format.
This file can be created with the following command:
.nf
.sp
.RS 10n
openssl dhparam -out /etc/sudo_logsrvd_dhparams.pem 2048
.RE
.fi
.RS 10n
.sp
By default,
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
will use the OpenSSL defaults for Diffie-Hellman key generation.
.RE
.TP 10n
tls_key = path
The path to the server's private key file, in PEM format.
The default value is
\fI/etc/ssl/sudo/private/logsrvd_key.pem\fR.
.TP 10n
tls_verify = bool
If true, the server certificate will be verified at startup and
clients will authenticate the server by verifying its certificate
and identity.
If false, no verification is performed of the server certificate
by the server or the client.
When using self-signed certificates without a certificate authority,
this setting should be set to false.
The default value is true.
.SS "iolog"
The
\fIiolog\fR
section configures I/O log parameters.
These settings are identical to the I/O configuration in
sudoers(@mansectform@).
The following keys are recognized:
.TP 10n
iolog_compress = boolean
If set, I/O logs will be compressed using
\fBzlib\fR.
Enabling compression can make it harder to view the logs in real-time as
the program is executing due to buffering.
The default value is
\fRfalse\fR.
.TP 10n
iolog_dir = path
The top-level directory to use when constructing the path
name for the I/O log directory.
The session sequence number, if any, is stored in the directory.
The default value is
\fI@iolog_dir@\fR.
.sp
The following percent
(\(oq%\(cq)
escape sequences are supported:
.PP
.RS 10n
.PD 0
.TP 6n
\fR%{seq}\fR
expanded to a monotonically increasing base-36 sequence number, such as 0100A5,
where every two digits are used to form a new directory, e.g.,
\fI01/00/A5\fR
.PD
.TP 6n
\fR%{user}\fR
expanded to the invoking user's login name
.TP 6n
\fR%{group}\fR
expanded to the name of the invoking user's real group-ID
.TP 6n
\fR%{runas_user}\fR
expanded to the login name of the user the command will
be run as (e.g., root)
.TP 6n
\fR%{runas_group}\fR
expanded to the group name of the user the command will
be run as (e.g., wheel)
.TP 6n
\fR%{hostname}\fR
expanded to the local host name without the domain name
.TP 6n
\fR%{command}\fR
expanded to the base name of the command being run
.PP
In addition, any escape sequences supported by the system's
strftime(3)
function will be expanded.
.sp
To include a literal
\(oq%\(cq
character, the string
\(oq%%\(cq
should be used.
.RE
.TP 10n
iolog_file = path
The path name, relative to
\fIiolog_dir\fR,
in which to store I/O logs.
Note that
\fIiolog_file\fR
may contain directory components.
The default value is
\fR%{seq}\fR.
.sp
See the
\fIiolog_dir\fR
setting above for a list of supported percent
(\(oq%\(cq)
escape sequences.
.sp
In addition to the escape sequences, path names that end in six or
more
\fRX\fRs
will have the
\fRX\fRs
replaced with a unique combination of digits and letters, similar to the
mktemp(3)
function.
.sp
If the path created by concatenating
\fIiolog_dir\fR
and
\fIiolog_file\fR
already exists, the existing I/O log file will be truncated and
overwritten unless
\fIiolog_file\fR
ends in six or
more
\fRX\fRs.
.TP 10n
iolog_flush = boolean
If set, I/O log data is flushed to disk after each write instead of
buffering it.
This makes it possible to view the logs in real-time as the program is
executing but may significantly reduce the effectiveness
of I/O log compression.
The default value is
\fRtrue\fR.
.TP 10n
iolog_group = name
The group name to look up when setting the group-ID on new I/O log
files and directories.
If
\fIiolog_group\fR
is not set,
the primary group-ID of the user specified by
\fIiolog_user is used.\fR
If neither
\fIiolog_group\fR
nor
\fIiolog_user\fR
are set, I/O log files and directories are created with group-ID 0.
.TP 10n
iolog_mode = mode
The file mode to use when creating I/O log files.
Mode bits for read and write permissions for owner, group or other
are honored, everything else is ignored.
The file permissions will always include the owner read and
write bits, even if they are not present in the specified mode.
When creating I/O log directories, search (execute) bits are added
to match the read and write bits specified by
\fIiolog_mode\fR.
The default value is
\fR0600\fR.
.TP 10n
iolog_user = name
The user name to look up when setting the owner of new
I/O log files and directories.
If
\fIiolog_group\fR
is set, it will be used instead of the user's primary group-ID.
By default, I/O log files and directories are created with user and
group-ID 0.
.TP 10n
maxseq = number
The maximum sequence number that will be substituted for the
\(lq\fR%{seq}\fR\(rq
escape in the I/O log file (see the
\fIiolog_dir\fR
description above for more information).
While the value substituted for
\(lq\fR%{seq}\fR\(rq
is in base 36,
\fImaxseq\fR
itself should be expressed in decimal.
Values larger than 2176782336 (which corresponds to the
base 36 sequence number
\(lqZZZZZZ\(rq)
will be silently truncated to 2176782336.
The default value is 2176782336.
.SS "eventlog"
The
\fIeventlog\fR
section configures how (and if) security policy events are logged.
.TP 6n
log_type = string
Where to log accept, reject and alert events reported by the policy.
Supported values are
\fIsyslog\fR,
\fIlogfile\fR,
and
\fInone\fR.
The default value is
\fIsyslog\fR.
.TP 6n
log_format = string
The event log format.
Supported log formats are
\(lqsudo\(rq
for traditional sudo-style logs and
\(lqjson\(rq
for JSON-format logs.
The JSON log entries contain the full contents of the accept, reject
and alert messages.
The default value is
\fIsudo\fR.
.SS "syslog"
The
\fIsyslog\fR
section configures how events are logged via
syslog(3).
.TP 6n
facility = string
Syslog facility if syslog is being used for logging.
Defaults to
\fR@logfac@\fR.
.sp
The following syslog facilities are supported:
\fBauthpriv\fR
(if your
OS supports it),
\fBauth\fR,
\fBdaemon\fR,
\fBuser\fR,
\fBlocal0\fR,
\fBlocal1\fR,
\fBlocal2\fR,
\fBlocal3\fR,
\fBlocal4\fR,
\fBlocal5\fR,
\fBlocal6\fR,
and
\fBlocal7\fR.
.TP 6n
accept_priority = string
Syslog priority to use when the user is allowed to run a command and
authentication is successful.
Defaults to
\fR@goodpri@\fR.
.sp
The following syslog priorities are supported:
\fBalert\fR,
\fBcrit\fR,
\fBdebug\fR,
\fBemerg\fR,
\fBerr\fR,
\fBinfo\fR,
\fBnotice\fR,
\fBwarning\fR,
and
\fBnone\fR.
Setting it to a value of
\fBnone\fR
will disable logging of successful commands.
.TP 6n
reject_priority = string
Syslog priority to use when the user is not allowed to run a command or
when authentication is unsuccessful.
Defaults to
\fR@badpri@\fR.
.sp
See
\fIaccept_priority\fR
for the list of supported syslog priorities.
.TP 6n
alert_priority = string
Syslog priority to use for event log alert messages received from the client.
Defaults to
\fR@badpri@\fR.
.sp
See
\fIaccept_priority\fR
for the list of supported syslog priorities.
.TP 6n
maxlen = number
On many systems,
syslog(3)
has a relatively small log buffer.
IETF RFC 5424 states that syslog servers must support messages of
at least 480 bytes and should support messages up to 2048 bytes.
By default,
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
creates log messages up to 960 bytes which corresponds to the
historic
BSD
syslog implementation which used a 1024 byte buffer
to store the message, date, hostname and program name.
.sp
To prevent syslog messages from being truncated,
\fBsudo_logsrvd\fR
will split up sudo-style log messages that are larger than
\fImaxlen\fR
bytes.
When a message is split, additional parts will include the string
\(lq(command continued)\(rq
after the user name and before the continued command line arguments.
JSON-format log entries are never split and are not affected by
\fImaxlen\fR.
.SS "logfile"
The
\fIlogfile\fR
section consists of settings related to logging to a plain file
(not syslog).
.TP 6n
path = string
The path to the file-based event log.
This path must be fully-qualified and start with a
\(oq/\(cq
character.
The default value is
\fI@logpath@\fR.
.TP 6n
time_format = string
The string used when formatting the date and time for file-based event logs.
Formatting is performed via the system's
strftime(3)
function so any escape sequences supported by that function will be expanded.
The default value is
\(lq\fR%h %e %T\fR\(rq
which produces dates like
\(lqOct 3 07:15:24\(rq
in the C locale.
