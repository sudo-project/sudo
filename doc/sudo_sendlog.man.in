.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsudo_sendlog\fR
can be used to send the existing
\fBsudoers\fR
I/O log
\fIpath\fR
to a remote log server such as
sudo_logsrvd(@mansectsu@)
for central storage.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP 12n
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\--ca-bundle\fR
The path to a certificate authority bundle file, in PEM format,
to use instead of the system's default certificate authority database
when authenticating the log server.
The default is to use the system's default certificate authority database.
.TP 12n
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\--cert\fR
The path to the client's certificate file in PEM format.
This setting is required when the connection to the remote log server
is secured with TLS.
.TP 12n
\fB\--help\fR
Display a short help message to the standard output and exit.
.TP 12n
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\--host\fR
Connect to the specified
\fIhost\fR
instead of localhost.
.TP 12n
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\--iolog-id\fR
Use the specified
\fIiolog-id\fR
when restarting a log transfer.
The
\fIiolog-id\fR
is reported by the server when it creates the remote I/O log.
This option may only be used in conjunction with the
\fB\-r\fR
option.
.TP 12n
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\--key\fR
.br
The path to the client's private key file in PEM format.
This setting is required when the connection to the remote log server
is secured with TLS.
.TP 12n
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\--no-verify\fR
If specified, the server's certificate will not be verified during
the TLS handshake.
By default,
\fBsudo_sendlog\fR
verifies that the server's certificate is valid and that it contains either
the server's host name or its IP address.
This setting is only supported when the connection to the remote log server
is secured with TLS.
.TP 12n
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\--port\fR
Use the specified network
\fIport\fR
when connecting to the log server instead of the
default, port 30344.
.TP 12n
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\--restart\fR
Restart an interrupted connection to the log server.
The specified
\fIrestart-point\fR
is used to tell the server the point in time at which to continue the log.
The
\fIrestart-point\fR
is specified in the form
\(lqseconds,nanoseconds\(rq
and is usually the last commit point received from the server.
The
\fB\-i\fR
option must also be specified when restarting a transfer.
.TP 12n
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\--test\fR
Open
\fInumber\fR
simultaneous connections to the log server and send the specified
I/O log file on each one.
This option is useful for performance testing.
.TP 12n
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\--version\fR
Print the
\fBsudo_sendlog\fR
version and exit.
.SS "Debugging sendlog"
