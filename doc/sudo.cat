       ssuuddoo allows a permitted user to execute a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d as the superuser or
       another user, as specified by the security policy.  The real and
       effective uid and gid are set to match those of the target user, as
       specified in the password database, and the group vector is initialized
       based on the group database (unless the --PP option was specified).

       ssuuddoo supports a plugin architecture for security policies and
       input/output logging.  Third parties can develop and distribute their
       own policy and I/O logging modules to work seemlessly with the ssuuddoo
       front end.  The default security policy is _s_u_d_o_e_r_s, which is configured
       via the file _/_e_t_c_/_s_u_d_o_e_r_s, or via LDAP.  See the PLUGINS section for
       more information.

       The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has to
       run ssuuddoo.  The policy may require that users authenticate themselves
       with a password or another authentication mechanism.  If authentication
       is required, ssuuddoo will exit if the user's password is not entered
       within a configurable time limit.  This limit is policy-specific; the
       default password prompt timeout for the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s security policy is 5
       minutes.

       Security policies may support credential caching to allow the user to
       run ssuuddoo again for a period of time without requiring authentication.
       The _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy caches credentials for 5 minutes, unless overridden
       in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s(4).  By running ssuuddoo with the --vv option, a user can update
       the cached credentials without running a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.

       When invoked as ssuuddooeeddiitt, the --ee option (described below), is implied.

       Security policies may log successful and failed attempts to use ssuuddoo.
       If an I/O plugin is configured, the running command's input and output
       may be logged as well.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       ssuuddoo accepts the following command line options:

       -A          Normally, if ssuuddoo requires a password, it will read it from
                   the user's terminal.  If the --AA (_a_s_k_p_a_s_s) option is
                   specified, a (possibly graphical) helper program is
                   executed to read the user's password and output the
                   password to the standard output.  If the SUDO_ASKPASS
                   environment variable is set, it specifies the path to the
                   helper program.  Otherwise, if _/_e_t_c_/_s_u_d_o_._c_o_n_f contains a
                   line specifying the askpass program, that value will be
                   used.  For example:

                       # Path to askpass helper program
                       Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass

                   If no askpass program is available, sudo will exit with an
                   error.

       -a _t_y_p_e     The --aa (_a_u_t_h_e_n_t_i_c_a_t_i_o_n _t_y_p_e) option causes ssuuddoo to use the
                   specified authentication type when validating the user, as
                   allowed by _/_e_t_c_/_l_o_g_i_n_._c_o_n_f.  The system administrator may
                   specify a list of sudo-specific authentication methods by
                   adding an "auth-sudo" entry in _/_e_t_c_/_l_o_g_i_n_._c_o_n_f.  This
                   option is only available on systems that support BSD
                   authentication.

       -b          The --bb (_b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d) option tells ssuuddoo to run the given
                   command in the background.  Note that if you use the --bb
                   option you cannot use shell job control to manipulate the
                   process.  Most interactive commands will fail to work
                   properly in background mode.

       -C _f_d       Normally, ssuuddoo will close all open file descriptors other
                   than standard input, standard output and standard error.
                   The --CC (_c_l_o_s_e _f_r_o_m) option allows the user to specify a
                   starting point above the standard error (file descriptor
                   three).  Values less than three are not permitted.  The
                   security policy may restrict the user's ability to use the
                   --CC option.  The _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy only permits use of the --CC
                   option when the administrator has enabled the
                   _c_l_o_s_e_f_r_o_m___o_v_e_r_r_i_d_e option.

       -c _c_l_a_s_s    The --cc (_c_l_a_s_s) option causes ssuuddoo to run the specified
                   command with resources limited by the specified login
                   class.  The _c_l_a_s_s argument can be either a class name as
                   defined in _/_e_t_c_/_l_o_g_i_n_._c_o_n_f, or a single '-' character.
                   Specifying a _c_l_a_s_s of - indicates that the command should
                   be run restricted by the default login capabilities for the
                   user the command is run as.  If the _c_l_a_s_s argument
                   specifies an existing user class, the command must be run
                   as root, or the ssuuddoo command must be run from a shell that
                   is already root.  This option is only available on systems
                   with BSD login classes.

       -D _l_e_v_e_l    Enable debugging of ssuuddoo plugins and ssuuddoo itself.  The
                   _l_e_v_e_l may be a value from 1 through 9.

       -E          The --EE (_p_r_e_s_e_r_v_e _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t) option indicates to the
                   security policy that the uses wishes to preserve their
                   existing environment variables.  The security policy may
                   return an error if the --EE option is specified and the user
                   does not have permission to preserve the environment.

       -e          The --ee (_e_d_i_t) option indicates that, instead of running a
                   command, the user wishes to edit one or more files.  In
                   lieu of a command, the string "sudoedit" is used when
                   consulting the security policy.  If the user is authorized
                   by the policy, the following steps are taken:

                   1.  Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited
                       with the owner set to the invoking user.

                   2.  The editor specified by the policy is run to edit the
                       temporary files.  The _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy uses the
                       SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR environment variables
                       (in that order).  If none of SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or
                       EDITOR are set, the first program listed in the _e_d_i_t_o_r
                       _s_u_d_o_e_r_s(4) option is used.

                   3.  If they have been modified, the temporary files are
                       copied back to their original location and the
                       temporary versions are removed.

                   If the specified file does not exist, it will be created.
                   Note that unlike most commands run by ssuuddoo, the editor is
                   run with the invoking user's environment unmodified.  If,
                   for some reason, ssuuddoo is unable to update a file with its
                   edited version, the user will receive a warning and the
                   edited copy will remain in a temporary file.

       -g _g_r_o_u_p    Normally, ssuuddoo runs a command with the primary group set to
                   the one specified by the password database for the user the
                   command is being run as (by default, root).  The --gg (_g_r_o_u_p)
                   option causes ssuuddoo to run the command with the primary
                   group set to _g_r_o_u_p instead.  To specify a _g_i_d instead of a
                   _g_r_o_u_p _n_a_m_e, use _#_g_i_d.  When running commands as a _g_i_d, many
                   shells require that the '#' be escaped with a backslash
                   ('\').  If no --uu option is specified, the command will be
                   run as the invoking user (not root).  In either case, the
                   primary group will be set to _g_r_o_u_p.

       -H          The --HH (_H_O_M_E) option requests that the security policy set
                   the HOME environment variable to the home directory of the
                   target user (root by default) as specified by the password
                   database.  Depending on the policy, this may be the default
                   behavior.

       -h          The --hh (_h_e_l_p) option causes ssuuddoo to print a short help

       -i [command]
                   The --ii (_s_i_m_u_l_a_t_e _i_n_i_t_i_a_l _l_o_g_i_n) option runs the shell
                   specified by the password database entry of the target user
                   as a login shell.  This means that login-specific resource
                   files such as .profile or .login will be read by the shell.
                   If a command is specified, it is passed to the shell for
                   execution via the shell's --cc option.  If no command is
                   specified, an interactive shell is executed.  ssuuddoo attempts
                   to change to that user's home directory before running the
                   shell.  The security policy shall initialize the
                   environment to a minimal set of variables, similar to what
                   is present when a user logs in.

       -K          The --KK (sure _k_i_l_l) option is like --kk except that it removes
                   the user's cached credentials entirely and may not be used
                   in conjunction with a command or other option.  This option
                   does not require a password.  Not all security policies
                   support credential caching.

       -k [command]
                   When used alone, the --kk (_k_i_l_l) option to ssuuddoo invalidates
                   the user's cached credentials.  The next time ssuuddoo is run a
                   password will be required.  This option does not require a
                   password and was added to allow a user to revoke ssuuddoo
                   permissions from a .logout file.  Not all security policies
                   support credential caching.

                   When used in conjunction with a command or an option that
                   may require a password, the --kk option will cause ssuuddoo to
                   ignore the user's cached credentials.  As a result, ssuuddoo
                   will prompt for a password (if one is required by the
                   security policy) and will not update the user's cached
                   credentials.

       -l[l] [_c_o_m_m_a_n_d]
                   If no _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is specified, the --ll (_l_i_s_t) option will list
                   the allowed (and forbidden) commands for the invoking user
                   (or the user specified by the --UU option) on the current
                   host.  If a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is specified and is permitted by the
                   security policy, the fully-qualified path to the command is
                   displayed along with any command line arguments.  If
                   _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is specified but not allowed, ssuuddoo will exit with a
                   status value of 1.  If the --ll option is specified with an ll
                   argument (i.e. --llll), or if --ll is specified multiple times,
                   a longer list format is used.

       -n          The --nn (_n_o_n_-_i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e) option prevents ssuuddoo from
                   prompting the user for a password.  If a password is
                   required for the command to run, ssuuddoo will display an error
                   messages and exit.

                   real and effective group IDs, however, are still set to
                   match the target user.

       -p _p_r_o_m_p_t   The --pp (_p_r_o_m_p_t) option allows you to override the default
                   password prompt and use a custom one.  The following
                   percent (`%') escapes are supported by the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy:

                   %H  expanded to the host name including the domain name (on
                       if the machine's host name is fully qualified or the
                       _f_q_d_n option is set in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s(4))

                   %h  expanded to the local host name without the domain name

                   %p  expanded to the name of the user whose password is
                       being requested (respects the _r_o_o_t_p_w, _t_a_r_g_e_t_p_w and
                       _r_u_n_a_s_p_w flags in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s(4))

                   %U  expanded to the login name of the user the command will
                       be run as (defaults to root unless the -u option is
                       also specified)

                   %u  expanded to the invoking user's login name

                   %%  two consecutive % characters are collapsed into a
                       single % character

                   The prompt specified by the --pp option will override the
                   system password prompt on systems that support PAM unless
                   the _p_a_s_s_p_r_o_m_p_t___o_v_e_r_r_i_d_e flag is disabled in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s.

       -r _r_o_l_e     The --rr (_r_o_l_e) option causes the new (SELinux) security
                   context to have the role specified by _r_o_l_e.

       -S          The --SS (_s_t_d_i_n) option causes ssuuddoo to read the password from
                   the standard input instead of the terminal device.  The
                   password must be followed by a newline character.

       -s [command]
                   The --ss (_s_h_e_l_l) option runs the shell specified by the _S_H_E_L_L
                   environment variable if it is set or the shell as specified
                   in the password database.  If a command is specified, it is
                   passed to the shell for execution via the shell's --cc
                   option.  If no command is specified, an interactive shell
                   is executed.

       -t _t_y_p_e     The --tt (_t_y_p_e) option causes the new (SELinux) security
                   context to have the type specified by _t_y_p_e.  If no type is
                   specified, the default type is derived from the specified
                   role.

       -U _u_s_e_r     The --UU (_o_t_h_e_r _u_s_e_r) option is used in conjunction with the

                   --ll option to specify the user whose privileges should be
                   listed.  The security policy may restrict listing other
                   users' privileges.  The _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy only allows root or
                   a user with the ALL privilege on the current host to use
                   this option.

       -u _u_s_e_r     The --uu (_u_s_e_r) option causes ssuuddoo to run the specified
                   command as a user other than _r_o_o_t.  To specify a _u_i_d
                   instead of a _u_s_e_r _n_a_m_e, use _#_u_i_d.  When running commands as
                   a _u_i_d, many shells require that the '#' be escaped with a
                   backslash ('\').  Security policies may restrict _u_i_ds to
                   those listed in the password database.  The _s_u_d_o_e_r_s policy
                   allows _u_i_ds that are not in the password database as long
                   as the _t_a_r_g_e_t_p_w option is not set.  Other security policies
                   may not support this.

       -V          The --VV (_v_e_r_s_i_o_n) option causes ssuuddoo to print its version
                   string and the version string of the security policy plugin
                   and any I/O plugins.  If the invoking user is already root
                   the --VV option will display the arguments passed to
                   configure when _s_u_d_o was built and plugins may display more
                   verbose information such as default options.

       -v          When given the --vv (_v_a_l_i_d_a_t_e) option, ssuuddoo will update the
                   user's cached credentials, authenticating the user's
                   password if necessary.  For the _s_u_d_o_e_r_s plugin, this
                   extends the ssuuddoo timeout for another 5 minutes (or whatever
                   the timeout is set to in _s_u_d_o_e_r_s) but does not run a
                   command.  Not all security policies support cached
                   credentials.

       --          The ---- option indicates that ssuuddoo should stop processing
                   command line arguments.

       Environment variables to be set for the command may also be passed on
       the command line in the form of VVAARR=_v_a_l_u_e, e.g.
       LLDD__LLIIBBRRAARRYY__PPAATTHH=_/_u_s_r_/_l_o_c_a_l_/_p_k_g_/_l_i_b.  Variables passed on the command
       line are subject to the same restrictions as normal environment
       variables with one important exception.  If the _s_e_t_e_n_v option is set in
       _s_u_d_o_e_r_s, the command to be run has the SETENV tag set or the command
       matched is ALL, the user may set variables that would overwise be
       forbidden.  See _s_u_d_o_e_r_s(4) for more information.

       Upon successful execution of a program, the exit status from ssuuddoo will
       simply be the exit status of the program that was executed.

       Otherwise, ssuuddoo exits with a value of 1 if there is a
       configuration/permission problem or if ssuuddoo cannot execute the given
       command.  In the latter case the error string is printed to the
       standard error.  If ssuuddoo cannot _s_t_a_t(2) one or more entries in the
       user's PATH, an error is printed on stderr.  (If the directory does not
       exist or if it is not really a directory, the entry is ignored and no
       error is printed.)  This should not happen under normal circumstances.
       The most common reason for _s_t_a_t(2) to return "permission denied" is if
       you are running an automounter and one of the directories in your PATH
       is on a machine that is currently unreachable.

SSEECCUURRIITTYY NNOOTTEESS
       ssuuddoo tries to be safe when executing external commands.

       To prevent command spoofing, ssuuddoo checks "." and "" (both denoting
       current directory) last when searching for a command in the user's PATH
       (if one or both are in the PATH).  Note, however, that the actual PATH
       environment variable is _n_o_t modified and is passed unchanged to the
       program that ssuuddoo executes.

       Please note that ssuuddoo will normally only log the command it explicitly
       runs.  If a user runs a command such as sudo su or sudo sh, subsequent
       commands run from that shell are not subject to ssuuddoo's security policy.

       their input and/or output logged, but there will not be traditional
       logs for those commands.  Because of this, care must be taken when
       giving users access to commands via ssuuddoo to verify that the command
       does not inadvertently give the user an effective root shell.  For more

       It is not meaningful to run the cd command directly via sudo, e.g.,
